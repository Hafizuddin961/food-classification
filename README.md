# food-classification
My first AI project specifically in deep learning for image classification.<br/>
The code really miserable since this my first time code during March 2018 for deep learning and this repo for my personal used.<br/>
Use Tensorflow and Keras framework to originally classify 5 type of food but failed to do that.
Intead, we can only classify only 2 type of food and we use pizza and burger dataset.
